## What is the purpose of the processEachInterval function?
The processEachInterval function is a callback function that processes each micro-batch of data in the streaming DataFrame. It transforms the incoming data by decoding and parsing the JSON values, selecting the required columns, and then writes the transformed data to a Parquet file.

## What is the significance of the epoch_id parameter in the processEachInterval function?
The epoch_id parameter represents the unique identifier for each micro-batch or epoch in the streaming DataFrame. It can be useful for tracking and analyzing the progress or behavior of the streaming job over time.

## What is the purpose of the schema variable?
The schema variable defines the structure of the JSON data that is being received from Kafka. It specifies the names and data types of each field in the JSON data, allowing Spark to parse and process the data correctly.

## Where is the transformed data being written?
The transformed data is being written to a Parquet file. The output path is specified by the dataSink variable, which represents the directory path where the Parquet files will be stored. The data is written in append mode, which means new data will be added to the existing files.

## What does the df.printSchema() statement do?
The df.printSchema() statement prints the schema of the DataFrame df. It displays the structure of the data, including the names of columns and their respective data types.

## How is the streaming DataFrame created from Kafka?
The streaming DataFrame is created using the readStream method on the sparkSesison object. The format method is used to specify the source as "kafka". The options such as Kafka bootstrap servers, topic to subscribe, and starting offsets are also provided.

## What is the purpose of the trigger method in the streaming query?
The trigger method specifies the trigger or interval at which the streaming query should be executed. In this case, it is set to processingTime=5 seconds, which means the micro-batches will be processed every 5 seconds.

## How is the streaming query started and terminated?
The streaming query is started using the start() method on the query object returned by the writeStream operation. The awaitTermination() method is then called to keep the application running until termination is explicitly requested.

## What happens if there is no data in the streaming DataFrame?
If there is no data in the streaming DataFrame, the processEachInterval function will not be executed. The code inside the function, which includes transforming and writing the data, will not be executed.

## How can you modify the code to change the output format from Parquet to a different format?
To change the output format, you would need to modify the write method in the processEachInterval function. Instead of .parquet(dataSink), you can use a different format such as .csv(dataSink) or .json(dataSink) to write the transformed data in the desired format.

## How is the logging configured in the code?
The logging is configured using the basicConfig method from the logging module. It specifies the log file name and format, including the timestamp, line number, logger name, log level, and log message. The log file is stored in the specified log directory.

## What is the purpose of the sparkSesison variable?
The sparkSesison variable represents the SparkSession object, which is the entry point for any Spark functionality. It is used to create a Spark application with the specified configuration and properties.

## How is the schema defined for the Cassandra table?
The schema for the Cassandra table is defined using the StructType class from the pyspark.sql.types module. It specifies the names and data types of the columns in the table, matching the structure of the data to be read from Cassandra.

## How is the data read from a Cassandra table into a Spark DataFrame?
The dataFrameFromCassandaDbTable function is used to read data from a Cassandra table into a Spark DataFrame. It utilizes the sparkSession.read method and provides the necessary options such as the table name, keyspace, and Cassandra connection details.

## What is the purpose of the sendDataToKafkaTopic function?
The sendDataToKafkaTopic function is responsible for sending the data from a DataFrame to a Kafka topic. It selects the required columns from the DataFrame and writes the data to the specified Kafka topic using the write method with the Kafka options such as bootstrap servers and topic name.

## How is the data being written to Kafka handled in terms of data loss?
The failOnDataLoss option is set to false when writing data to Kafka. This means that if there is any data loss during the write operation, it will not cause the streaming job to fail. This can be useful in scenarios where data loss is acceptable, such as in some streaming use cases.

## How is the Kafka source subscribed to a specific topic?
The option("subscribe", KAFKA_TOPIC) method is used to subscribe the Kafka source to the specified topic. This ensures that the streaming DataFrame receives the data from the specified Kafka topic.

## How is the starting offset for consuming data from Kafka set to "earliest"?
The option("startingOffsets", "earliest") method is used to set the starting offset for consuming data from Kafka to the earliest available offset. This ensures that the streaming DataFrame starts consuming data from the beginning of the topic.

## What happens if there is an exception or error during the streaming query execution?
If there is an exception or error during the streaming query execution, it will be logged in the specified log file. The log level is set to INFO in the provided code, but you can modify it as per your requirements.

## How can you modify the processing interval for the streaming query?
You can modify the PROCESSING_INTERVAL variable to change the processing interval for the streaming query. Currently, it is set to "5 seconds", but you can adjust it to a different value, such as "10 seconds" or "1 minute", to control the frequency of micro-batch processing.
