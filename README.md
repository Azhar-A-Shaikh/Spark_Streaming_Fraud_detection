#Fraud Detection Pipeline Using Big Data
## Overview
The Fraud Detection Pipeline is a scalable and intelligent solution designed to analyze customer transaction history and predict whether new transactions are legitimate or fraudulent. It utilizes Big Data technologies and follows a streamlined process from data acquisition to real-time prediction.

## Data Acquisition
The pipeline begins by understanding the data requirements and exploring online open sources that provide the necessary transaction data. Automation techniques are employed to retrieve and load the data into the pipeline, ensuring a continuous flow of updated information.

## Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis
Once the data is acquired, a robust data wrangling and transformation pipeline is implemented. This stage involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and performing feature engineering to extract meaningful insights. Exploratory data analysis techniques are applied to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data, identifying patterns, trends, and potential outliers.

## NoSQL Database Storage ( CASSANDRA DB )
The cleaned and transformed data is stored in a NoSQL database hosted on a cloud platform. NoSQL databases offer scalability, flexibility, and high-performance data storage, ensuring efficient handling of large volumes of transaction data. The cloud infrastructure provides seamless access and management of the database.

## Model Creation and Fraud Detection
Using the stored data, a machine learning model is developed to predict fraudulent transactions. The model is trained on historical transaction data, leveraging advanced algorithms and techniques such as anomaly detection and supervised learning. The trained model is capable of accurately identifying fraudulent transactions based on various features and patterns.

## Real-Time Prediction and Streaming
To enable real-time fraud detection, the pipeline incorporates streaming capabilities using Apache Kafka or similar tools. Streaming data from various sources, such as live transactions or incoming data feeds, is processed in real-time. The trained model is applied to the streaming data to identify potential fraudulent transactions as they occur, enabling swift action to mitigate risks.

## Scalability and Big Data Technologies
The entire pipeline is designed using Big Data technologies to handle the massive volume, variety, and velocity of transaction data. Distributed processing frameworks like Apache Spark or Hadoop are employed for scalable and parallel data processing. The pipeline can effortlessly scale as the volume of data increases, ensuring efficient and accurate fraud detection.

The Fraud Detection Pipeline provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing customer transaction history, detecting fraudulent transactions, and performing real-time prediction. By leveraging Big Data technologies and intelligent algorithms, it enables organizations to proactively identify and prevent financial fraud, safeguarding their assets and maintaining the trust of their customers.
